# Motorola 88000 Emulator

A Rust implementation of a Motorola 88000 CPU emulator, providing cycle-accurate emulation of the M88000 RISC processor architecture.

## Features

- Complete instruction set implementation
- Memory Management Unit (MMU) support
- Floating point operations
- Cache emulation (stubbed)
- Exception handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Architecture Overview

The emulator implements the core components of the Motorola 88000 architecture:

### CPU Core
- 32 general-purpose registers (r0-r31)
- Program counter (PC)
- Control registers
- Condition codes
- Exception handling support

### Instruction Categories
- Arithmetic operations (integer and floating-point)
- Logical operations
- Control flow instructions
- Memory access operations
- System instructions
- MMU operations
- Vector operations

### Memory Management
- Virtual memory support
- Page table management
- TLB operations
- Memory protection

## Implementation Details

### Instruction Set

The emulator implements all major M88000 instruction categories:

1. **Arithmetic Instructions**
   - Integer operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
   - Unsigned variants
   - Compare operations
   - Long multiplication/division

2. **Logical Instructions**
   - Basic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
   - Bit field operations
   - Bit manipulation
   - Rotation/shift operations

3. **Control Flow Instructions**
   - Conditional branches
   - Jump operations
   - Subroutine calls
   - Exception handling

4. **Memory Access Instructions**
   - Load/Store operations
   - Multiple data sizes (byte, half-word, word)
   - Atomic operations

5. **Floating Point Instructions**
   - Basic arithmetic
   - Comparisons
   - Conversions
   - Exception handling

6. **System Instructions**
   - Cache management
   - System control
   - Privileged operations

7. **MMU Instructions**
   - Page table management
   - TLB operations
   - Address translation

### Memory System

The memory system implements:
- Virtual memory translation
- Page table walking
- TLB caching
- Memory protection checks
- Big-endian byte ordering

## Usage

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Example Usage

```rust
use m88k_emu::{CPU, Memory};

fn main() {
    let mut cpu = CPU::new();
    let mut memory = Memory::new();
    
    // Initialize CPU state
    cpu.registers[1] = 42;
    cpu.registers[2] = 24;
    
    // Execute instructions
    // ...
}
```

## Testing

The emulator includes comprehensive test coverage for:
- All instruction categories
- Memory operations
- MMU functionality
- Exception handling
- Floating point operations
- System instructions
